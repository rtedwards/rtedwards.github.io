The walrus operator uses the new walrus-like syntax :=, to assign variables within an expression.\nIt’s been out for a few years at this point (at the time of writing Python 3.12 is around the corner) and I’ve found some joy in how it’s helped elegantly shorten some parts of my code. Here are the ways I’ve made use of the walrus operator."

For example, when parsing user inputs and performing validation. In the following snippet, we want to validate user inputs x, y, and z. If there’s a validation problem, validate will return a string with a message explaining what is wrong with the input and a message of how to fix. These messages get appended to a list so all validation messages can be printed out together.\nvalidation_errors = []\nif msg := validate(x):\n    validation_errors += msg\n\nif msg := validate(y):\n    validation_errors += msg\n\nif msg := validate(z):\n    validation_errors += msg\n\nif validation_errors: # a non-empty list resolves to True\n    for error in validation_errors:\n        print(error)\n    return"

    "text": "An Over-the-Top Overuse Example\nWhile the walrus operator is handy for shaving off a few lines of code, inlining too much can make code difficult to reason about. Use it sparingly, especially with other code-golfing operators. For example, with the ternary operator.\nheight = get_height(name) if (name := get_name(user_id)) else None\nI think this can be okay but I also think it’s clearer written long-form,\nif name := get_name(user_id):\n    height = get_height(name)\nelse:\n    height = None\nIt could be formatted over multiple lines so it’s just as readible as a normal if / else and to keep the benefits of the ternary usage by only assigning height once, but it’s now a whopping 5 lines.\nheight = (\n    get_height(name)\n    if (name := get_name(user_id))\n    else None\n)\nAnd remember, just because you can doesn’t mean you should write code like below, if you can avoid it. This example is modified from my own code.\nparams: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]\n\nsampler_weights = (\n    {\n        ModeEnum(mode): weight\n        for mode, weight in normalize_weights(weights).items()\n    }\n    if (weights := params.get(\"sampler\", {}).get(\"weights\"))\n    else {\"x\": 0.5, \"y\": 0.5}\n)\nHere, I’ve slapped a dictionary comprehension, a ternary operator, and a walrus operator into the same expression. There’s a lot going on, but it’s formatted over multiple lines to help delineate what’s happening. The variable, params, holds the contents of a configuration .toml that I needed to parse some weights from and convert into an dictionary of {enum: weight}."

    "text": "Last week, my company held a pub quiz. This was no ordinary pub quiz, it was designed in a way for teams to learn about other teams. One person from each team submitted four questions about their team. We ended up wtih about 60 questions from all across the company. And when I say “all” I mean all. We had questions about Data Science, Commercial, Operations, Engineering, Product, Marketing, Leadership, Human Resources, you name it. As someone who is fairly familiar with all aspects of our products and engineering teams (but by no means an expert in all these areas) by having been here over four years and written my share of documentation, I came into the pub quiz with confidence. Much of that confidence due to expecting to not need to know British pop culture back through the 70s as is standard in an actual pub quiz.\nThat confidence was quickly smashed with questions like:\n\nWhat was the 2023 Coca Cola Christmas commercial slogan?\nWhat is the collective age of the Customer Support team?\nWhat month was repo XXX created?\n\nThe Data Science round was the trickiest of them all, in no small part because reading the question took up almost all of the response time! After the quiz, my teammate who wrote the Data Science questions shared one that didn’t quite make the cut.\nI share the question with the reader here, with only some minor rewording. My answer follows."

How do independent Normally distributed random variables sum? If you don’t remember, don’t worry, neither did I. After some revision we know that (Ross 2010):\n\\[\n\\displaylines{\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\text{E}[X + Y]   &= \\text{E}[X] + \\text{E}[Y] \\\\\n    \\text{Var}[X + Y] &= \\text{Var}[X] + \\text{Var}[Y] + 2\\text{Cov}[X,Y]\n    \\end{align}\n}\n\\]\nThe assumption that the random variables are independent means the covariance is zero, \\(2\\text{Cov}[X,Y] = 0\\). We can simply add the means and variances (Ross 2010, 256–57) giving:\n\\[\n\\displaylines{\n    \\begin{alignat*}{2}\n    y^* &= y &&+ u \\\\\n        &= \\alpha + \\beta x &&+ \\epsilon + u \\\\\n        &= \\alpha + \\beta x &&+ \\epsilon^* \\\\\n        &= \\alpha + \\beta x &&+ \\Big( N(\\mu_{\\epsilon}, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2) + N(\\mu_u, \\sigma_u^2) \\Big) \\\\\n        &= \\alpha + \\beta x &&+ \\Big( N(\\mu_{\\epsilon} + \\mu_u, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2 + \\sigma_u^2) \\Big) \\\\\n        &= \\alpha + \\beta x &&+ N(0 + 2, 1 + 4) \\\\\n        &= \\alpha + \\beta x &&+ N(2, 5) \\\\\n    \\end{alignat*}\n}\n\\]\nwhere,\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\displaylines{\n    \\begin{alignat*}{2}\n    \\mu_{\\epsilon^*} &= \\mu_{\\epsilon} &&+ \\mu_u \\\\\n        &= 0 &&+ 2 \\\\\n        &= 2\n    \\end{alignat*}\n}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\displaylines{\n    \\begin{alignat*}{2}\n    \\sigma_{\\epsilon^*}^2 &= \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2 &&+ \\sigma_u^2 \\\\\n        &= 1 &&+ 4 \\\\\n        &= 5\n    \\end{alignat*}\n}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nPlugging in the values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), we find the following solution: \\[\ny^* = 3 + 2x + N(2, 5)\n\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha^* = 3\\)\n\\(\\beta^* = 2\\)\n\\(u^* = 2\\)\n\\(\\sigma^* = \\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n\n\n\nRemember, we were asked for \\(\\sigma^*\\) not \\(\\sigma^{*2}\\).\nWe can arguably simplify this a bit further by noting that the bias, \\(\\alpha\\), and the mean of the residuals, \\(\\mu_{\\epsilon^*}\\), are both constants that shift the intercept and can be grouped. Subtracting the mean of the error from the bias…\n\\[\n\\displaylines{\n    \\begin{alignat*}{3}\n    y^* &= \\alpha &&+ \\beta x &&&+ N(2, 5) \\\\\n        &= 3      &&+ 2x      &&&+ N(2, 5) \\\\\n        &= (3-2)  &&+ 2x      &&&+ N(0, 5) \\\\\n        &= 1      &&+ 2x      &&&+ N(0,5)\n    \\end{alignat*}\n}\n\\]\nAnd rewritting using the standard deviation rather than the variance (like in the original question) we arrive at:\n\\[\ny = 1 + 2x + N(0,\\sqrt{5})\n\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha^* = 1\\)\n\\(\\beta^* = 2\\)\n\\(u^* = 2\\)\n\\(\\sigma^* = \\sqrt{5}\\)"

    "text": "Last week, my company held a pub quiz. This was no ordinary pub quiz, it was designed in a way for teams to learn about other teams. One person from each team submitted four questions about their team. We ended up wtih about 60 questions from all across the company. And when I say “all” I mean all. We had questions about Data Science, Commercial, Operations, Engineering, Product, Marketing, Leadership, Human Resources, you name it. As someone who is fairly familiar with all aspects of our products and engineering teams (but by no means an expert in all these areas) by having been here over four years and written my share of documentation, I came into the pub quiz with confidence. Much of that confidence due to expecting to not need to know British pop culture back through the 70s as is standard in an actual pub quiz.\nThat confidence was quickly smashed with questions like:\n\nWhat was the 2023 Coca Cola Christmas commercial slogan?\nWhat is the collective age of the Customer Support team?\nWhat month was repo XXX created?\n\nThe Data Science round was the trickiest of them all, in no small part because reading the question took up almost all of the response time! After the quiz, my teammate who wrote the Data Science questions shared one that didn’t quite make the cut.\nI share the question with the reader here, with only some minor rewording. My answer follows."

    "text": "# In the end, it didn’t even matter\nThankfully, this question didn’t make it into our company pub quiz. Even if it had, I think everyone (sans the author) would have had to ultimately guess the answer. We only had 30 seconds per question. I didn’t even finish reading the problem statement let alone begin tackling it in that time!\nIn the end, whether this question would have been included or not, wouldn’t have changed the outcome. The quiz was neck and neck between 3 teams for most of the game. My team bouncing between \\(\\text{1}^{st}\\) and \\(\\text{3}^{rd}\\) place. That is until the final round of questions from the Leadership team, which were highly specific to a certain someone.\n\n\nIf we have another pub quiz, I’ll make sure to sling in some equally maladjusted questions. But I’ll post the answers beforehand here.\n\nWatch this space.\nGood thing I had the CEO on my team 🥇"
