# Exams in Scotland

Exams in Scotland have a different format than exams in the States, or even in England.  Most, if you're unlucky all, exams are taken at the end of semester 2.  In theory this has the advantage of letting students sit on the material longer and let other courses reinforce understanding.  In practice, students are given over a month to self-manage their time and study for 6 to 10 exams that are all taken within a 3 week period.  However most are pushed to the last week, I assume to give students the maximum time possible for revision.

This is a flawed system because students are essentially sprinting the last leg of a marathon turned into a decathalon.
